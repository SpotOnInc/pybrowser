# PyDrvr
## About
PyDrvr is a Python implementation of the [WebDriver JSON Wire Protocol](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol) aimed at being simple, usable, and smart. It was built to be a faster, lighter, and easier replacement to Selenium. PyDrvr was intended to be used in front-end testing, but has applications across a large set of common automation and scripting problems.
